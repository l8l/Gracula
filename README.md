Outline/ideas
1) Create an environment in which one can display (rotate around, zoom into) any shape
2) Program a "plotter" which can turn mathematical parameterisations or implicit
equations into shapes which are then displayed in the environment created in 1)
3) Extend environment such that one can move around in a world with multiple
shapes
4) Connect simple functions like moving and rotating with sensors
And if we then still have time and energy, we could
5) Try to influence shapes, maybe even form simple shapes with sensor input
But these are just ideas - let's see what else will happen = )
